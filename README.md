# Diabetic Retinopathy Prediction Using Multi-Classifier Approach

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a serious eye disease caused by diabetes, which can lead to blindness if not diagnosed and treated early. This project utilizes a **multi-classifier approach** to predict the severity of DR using machine learning and deep learning techniques. By leveraging multiple classifiers, including **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost**, the system improves accuracy and robustness in diagnosing DR from retinal fundus images.

## Dataset
- **Dataset Used**: Colored retinal images from `colored_images.zip`.
- **Data Type**: Fundus images labeled according to diabetic retinopathy severity.
- **Classification Categories**:
  1. No DR (Healthy)
  2. Mild DR
  3. Moderate DR
  4. Severe DR
  5. Proliferative DR
- **Annotations**: Each image is labeled according to severity to train the classifiers.

## Preprocessing Steps
- **Image Resizing**: Standardizing all images to a fixed size for input consistency.
- **Normalization**: Adjusting pixel intensity values for better model performance.
- **Data Augmentation**: Applying transformations such as rotation, flipping, and contrast adjustments.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracting relevant patterns using **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and Wavelet Transforms**.

## Models Used
This project uses a **multi-classifier approach** to compare and evaluate different models:
1. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** â€“ Extracts spatial features from fundus images.
2. **Random Forest** â€“ Tree-based ensemble model for classification.
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** â€“ Finds the optimal hyperplane for classification.
4. **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)** â€“ Classifies based on the closest labeled images.
5. **Gradient Boosting** â€“ Sequential learning model to reduce classification errors.
6. **XGBoost** â€“ Optimized gradient boosting algorithm for enhanced accuracy.

## Evaluation Metrics
The models are evaluated using:
- **Accuracy** â€“ Measures the overall correctness of the predictions.
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-score** â€“ Evaluates per-class classification performance.
- **AUC-ROC Curve** â€“ Analyzes the performance of the classifiers.
- **Confusion Matrix** â€“ Compares actual versus predicted classifications.

## Libraries & Tools Used
- **Google Colab** â€“ Used for model training and execution.
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn.
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV.
- **Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy.
